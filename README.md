# README

Some experiments looking into the behavior of AWS Network ACLs and Security Groups.

I was interested if they sent any signal that packets were rejected (e.g. ICMP or TCP RST) or if they just silently dropped packets.

See [this article](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~peterb/network/drop-vs-reject) for a nice discussion of DROP vs REJECT, and [this article](https://serverfault.com/questions/157375/reject-vs-drop-when-using-iptables) for a lot of confusing opinions. :)

See [my self-answered Q&A about this topic on StackExchange](https://serverfault.com/questions/1028863/do-aws-security-groups-and-rules-and-network-acls-reject-or-drop-traffic/1028864#1028864).

## Experimental design

I set up 2 AWS hosts in 2 different subnets of the same VPC. I used `t2.nano`s running Ubuntu 18.04. I ran in region `us-east-1` using AZs `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b`. The subnets used the same network ACL association and security group for the test.

Between each step, I rolled back any changes I made to the network (iptables, security groups, ACLs) to block traffic to make sure requests succeeded again before going on to the next experient.

Each experiment looked like the following. I happened to be running in 4 tmux panes.

```bash
# pane 1, host 1 (172.31.26.130)
# Sends an http request to host 2
curl -s 172.31.43.42:8000 >/dev/null; echo $?

# pane 2, host 1 (172.31.26.130)
# Capture tcp dump of all traffic to the host and dump into a file
tcpdump host 172.31.43.42 -w my-capture-file.txt

# pane 3, host 2 (172.31.43.42)
# Run simple http server on port 8000
python3 -m http.server 8000

# pane 4, host 2 (172.31.43.42)

# Misc management activities with iptables, for example:
# List
iptables -L --line-numbers
# Delete numbered rule
# Rules were cleared after each experiment
iptables -D INPUT 1
# Add rule
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j REJECT
```

### TCP dumps for various network configurations

## Successful request

This is a normal happy HTTP request. All other requests are disrupted in some ways.

## iptables REJECT rule

Added a rule to reject traffic with: `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j REJECT`.
The connection closes quickly because of the ICMP packet sent back by iptables on host 2.

```

```

## iptables DROP rule

Added a rule to reject traffic with: `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j DROP`.
You can see tcp sending 3 sequential packets waiting for an ack (with time stretching out due to TCP backoff) until curl times out.

```

```

## iptables reject-with tcp-reset

Added a rule to reject traffic with: `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset`.
The connection closes quickly because of the ACK/RST packet sent back by iptables on host 2.

```
16:00:06.460948 IP 172.31.26.130.57096 > 172.31.43.42.irdmi: Flags [S], seq 1896170312, win 62727, options [mss 8961,sackOK,TS val 3227646967 ecr 0,nop,wscale 6], length 0
16:00:06.462325 IP 172.31.43.42.irdmi > 172.31.26.130.57096: Flags [R.], seq 0, ack 1896170313, win 0, length 0
```

## Security group deny

We removed the security group setting allowing all TCP traffic to other nodes of the same security group.
The only other security group rules were allowing ssh from a set of subnets associated with our office VPN, so nodes in the subnset could no longer communicate with each other.
This looks identical to iptables in `DROP` mode. No response is sent and curl times out.

```

## Network ACL deny

We added a network ACL rule to drop all incoming traffic on port 8000.
This looks identical to iptables in `DROP` mode. No response is sent and curl times out.
